{"name":"DoctrineFormGenerator","tagline":"Provides the ability to dynamically generate Forms from Doctrine2 models in Symfony2","body":"### Objective\r\nWhen you create a Doctrine2 model, you define your database schema. In order to utilize your new model in a CRUD action, you need to create a Form, and redefine each field, and how it should be validated. DoctrineFormGenerator aims to prevent this duplication of work by allowing you to dynamically generate your form from your model, preventing the need to create additional form definitions for your CRUD operations.\r\n\r\n### Implementation\r\nInitial implementation of the project will provide the ability to dynamically create a form at run-time via the Symfony2's createForm method passed with no parameters. This form will be based off the Doctrine2 model's field schema.\r\n\r\n#### Next steps\r\nSupport for other field schema definition methods, YAML XML and PHP definitions.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nThis project was started by the team at @cygnusb2b.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHave an issue or want to contribute to the project?
